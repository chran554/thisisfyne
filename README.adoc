== Build and run application

This project is developed using MacOS and Makefile as build tool.

If you are using another OS and not using Makefile you can most likely find out how to build the application by inspecting the `Makefile` and issue the commands manually.

* Install go (duh!)
* Install fyne dependencies. +
  Read the getting started docs at https://fyne.io/[fyne site].
* Build with: `make all`
* Run with: `./bin/thisisfyne` after build

=== Build MacOS app

You can use fyne to build a MacOS application (with application icon).

* Build with `make macos-app`
* Look for the application (using Finder) in `./bin`directory and double-click it (or drag it to the Applications folder).
