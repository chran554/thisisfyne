= This is Fyne

This is a project to try out and test the https://fyne.io/[*Fyne* UI library] for golang. +
(fyne version v2.4.3 in 2024-02-14)

== Functionality

First of all, I never intended this application to be useful or solve any problem or use case in any way.
I just felt I needed some idea of a image-based program to aim for when trying out Fyne.

The application can open a directory with jpg-images with names on the format `selfieXX_YY.jpg`. Where `XX` is a number, `selfieXX` is the name of the set of selfie images and `YY` is a number for each selfie in the selfie set. +
A bunch of test images can be found under `images/selfies`.

You can assign a status to each set of selfies ("not handled", "ok", "suspicious" and "fake").

The application can export a json-report on the selfie sets and their given status.

To efficiently navigate the application using keyboard:

. You can scroll through the list of selfie sets by `↑` (up) and `↓` (down) keys.
. You can scroll through selfies in a selfie set by using the `←` (left) and `→` (right) keys.
. You can set status for a selfie set by using keys `1`, `2` , `3` and `4`.

== Build and run application

This project is developed using macOS and Makefile as build tool.

If you are using another OS and not using Makefile, you can most likely find out how to build the application by inspecting the `Makefile` and issue the commands manually.
