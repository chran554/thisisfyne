== Build and run application

This project is developed using macOS and Makefile as build tool.

If you are using another OS and not using Makefile, you can most likely find out how to build the application by inspecting the `Makefile` and issue the commands manually.

* Install go (duh!) +
  Use https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/go[brew] or use go https://go.dev/doc/install[download and install]
